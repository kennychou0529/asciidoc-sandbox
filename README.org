* Strahlex's Docs and Notes Sandbox
  It may be a bit confusing that this repository is called =asciidoc-sandbox=
  as it also contains Markdown and Org files. However, it all started with
  Asciidoc.

  In this repository you can find documentation mock-ups and notes to things
  around BeagleBone Black, Machinekit and many more. Please understand that
  the repository does not follow any hierarchical pattern or any other sort of
  order. If you find any errors feel free to create a PR or to create a issue.
