As QtQuick 2 renders all its contents in the so called "SceneGraph" it comes per default with OpenGL under the hood. This makes a OpenGL based preview window for GCode very attractive.

Currently there are only few graphics frameworks available that target QtQuick 2. However, it turned out that implementing currently available OpenGL based application into QtQuick 2 is no problem at all. The http://qt-project.org/doc/qt-5/qtquick-scenegraph-openglunderqml-example.html[OpenGL under QML] demo application demonstrates the necessary steps to embed OpenGL code into QML.
