* Machinetalk Sync Protocol
Proposal for sync protocol for Machinetalk. The purpose this protocol is reliable 
syncronization between two instances. Currently two services require this type of
protocol *halrcomp* for syncing state of HAL remote components and *param* for syncing
key-value pair parameters.

** Networking pattern
The Machinetalk sync protocol uses 3 channels. The channels are named from the viewpoint of the server/master of the session:
- *Sync channel:* Based on Machinetalk RPC, is used for state synchronization, exchange of security information and error notification
- *Pub channel:* Publishes state changes from master to clients
- *Sub channel:* Publishes state changes from client to master.
